Description: Designs guide RNA for CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing and provides 
    information on sequence features pertinent to guide efficiency. 
    Sequence features include annotated off-target predictions in a
    user-selected genome and a predicted efficiency score based on the 
    model described in Doench et al. (2016) <doi:10.1038/nbt.3437>. 
    Users are able to import additional genomes and genome annotation 
    files to use when searching and annotating off-target hits. All 
    guide RNA and off-target data can be generated through the R console 
    with sgRNA_Design() or through 'crispRdesignR's' user interface with 
    crispRdesignRUI().
