Description: This package aims to provide scientifically pertinent information 
	when designing guide RNA sequences for Cas9 genome editing. When provided 
	a target DNA sequence for editing, a genome to check for off-targets in, 
	and a genome annotation file (.gtf), it will output information for two 
	separate data tables. The first table contains information on the generated 
	sgRNA (sgRNA sequence, PAM, Direction, Start, End, GC content, Presence of 
	Homopolymers, Regions of Self Complementarity, Effciency Score (Doench 
	2016), Number of Potential Off-Target sequences, and Notes on the sgRNA). 
	The second table contains information on the found off-target sequences 
	(Original sgRNA Sequence, Chromosome, Start, End, Number of Mismatches, 
	Direction, CFD Scores, Matched Sequence, Gene ID, Gene Name, Sequence Type, 
	and Exon Number). This data can be generated through the command line or 
	through crispRdesignR's GUI. Additionally, a user may provide their own DNA 
	libraries and genome annotation files when searching for off-targets.
