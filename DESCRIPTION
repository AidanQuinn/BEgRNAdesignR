Description: Designs guide RNA for CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing and provides 
    information on sgRNA sequence features pertinent to guide efficiency. 
    Sequence features include GC content, presence of homopolymers, regions 
    of self complementarity, potential off-target hits, and a predicted
    efficiency score based on the model described in Doench et al. (2016) 
    <doi:10.1038/nbt.3437>. Users are able to import genomes and genome 
    annotation files to use when searching and annotating off-target hits. 
    All sgRNA and off-target data can be generated through the R console 
    with sgRNA_Design() or through crispRdesignR's user interface with 
    crispRdesignRUI().
