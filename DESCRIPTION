Title: sgRNA Design for CRISPR/Cas9
Version: 1.0

Description: This package aims to provide all scientifically pertinent information when
  designing guide RNA sequences for Cas9 genome editing. When provided a target DNA 
  sequence for editing, a genome to check for off-targets in, and a genome annotation 
  file (.gtf) to provide addition information about off-target matches it will out put 
  information for two separate data tables. The first table contains all information on 
  the generated sgRNA themselves (sgRNA sequence, PAM, Direction, Start, End, GC content,
  Presence of Homopolymers, Effciency Score (Doench 2016), and Genomic Matches). The 
  second table contains all information on the found off-target sequences (Original 
  sgRNA Sequence, Chromosome, Start, End, Number of Mismatches, Direction, CFD Scores, 
  Matched Sequence, Gene ID, Gene Name, Sequence Type, and Exon Number).
