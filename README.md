# crispRdesignR
Software used to design guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing

The crispRdesignR package allows a user to design sgRNA directly in R with a few simple commands. This tool provides a wide variety of information about the generated sgRNA and allows the user to submit their own genomes to search for off-targets in.
